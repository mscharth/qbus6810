    "The first step in any data project is to get the data ready for analysis. In a traditional curriculum, the dataset was usually taken for granted and ready for analysis from the start. However, this no longer reflects the reality in industry: the trend towards [big data](http://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2016/04/28/big-data-overload-most-companies-cant-deal-with-the-data-explosion/#52c807d83920) brought with it an increased demand for professionals that have the computational skills to work with possibly large, complex and unstructured data. It is [commonly stated](https://www.r-bloggers.com/the-real-prerequisite-for-machine-learning-isnt-math-its-data-analysis/) that up to 80% of a data scientist's job can be data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualisation. \n",

    "In this lesson we explore the basics of how to use the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) package to work  with data in Python. Pandas is an industry-standard library that provides a highly flexible data structure called a dataframe, which makes data manipulation fast and easy. As a complement to this tutorial, the <a href=\"http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html\" target=\"_blank\">10 minutes to pandas</a> tutorial in the official pandas documentation is also a useful starting reference.\n",

In practical business situations, you may often need to obtain data from a [relational database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database) rather than a flat file stored in your computer.

    "A pandas `DataFrame` has some similarities to a spreadsheet. However, unlike a spreadsheet, you are not able to click through it or manually make modifications in the current setup. We do everything through coding. This may initially feel restrictive, but it is ultimately more efficient and scalable to work in this way. Some Python environments have GUIs (graphical user interfaces) that allow you to view and modify dataframes by clicking through an interface.  \n",
